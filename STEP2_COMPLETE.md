## 🚀 Next Steps to Push to GitHub

### **IMPORTANT**: Follow these steps in order

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click "+" → "New repository"
3. Name: `library-book-management`
4. Description: "Library Book Management System with CRUD, Statistics Dashboard, and Bulk Import"
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 2: Get Repository URL
After creating, GitHub will show you the URL. It looks like:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/library-book-management.git
```

#### Step 3: Add Remote Origin
In your terminal, run:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/library-book-management.git
```
*(Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)*

#### Step 4: Push to GitHub
```bash
# Rename branch to main (recommended)
git branch -M main

# Push all commits
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 5: Verify
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Refresh the page
- See all files uploaded
